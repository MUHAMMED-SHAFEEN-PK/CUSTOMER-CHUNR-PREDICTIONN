# CUSTOMER-CHUNR-PREDICTIONN

# Problem Statement

      The goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on their demographic details,
      service usage patterns, and subscription behavior.

 # Key Objectives: 
    dentify factors that influence churn (e.g., high support calls, contract type, monthly charges).

    Build a predictive model that accurately classifies customers as likely to churn or stay.
   
    Improve business decisions by identifying at-risk customers early and taking preventive actions.
      
 # DOMAIN
    Customer demographics (Age, Gender)

    Subscription details (Tenure, Subscription Type)

    Engagement metrics (Usage Frequency, Support Calls)

    Financial behavior (Payment Delay, Total Spend)
 
    Target variable: Churn (whether the customer left or stayed)    

    
# Goal: 
     Predict whether a customer is likely to churn from a subscription-based service.
# Real World Impact
# Business Impact: 
     Reduce customer churn, improve retention, and boost revenue..
     
# ML :
     Binary classification: 1 = Churned, 0 = Retained
